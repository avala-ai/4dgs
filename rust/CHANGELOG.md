# Changelog

All notable changes to the Rust crate are documented here, following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Decoder: TLV container, streamed and indexed readers, both adaptive-precision rules, validity
  windows, whole-degree spherical harmonic bands, `deflate` by default with `zstd` behind a feature,
  and the audio, camera, metadata, attachment, statistics and summary-offset records.
- `include/fourdgs.h`: a C ABI for decoding, and the surface the C++ and Swift packages bind to.
  Nothing unwinds across it, every fallible call returns a status, and null is safe to pass.
- Conformance runners in `rust/conformance`, wired into the shared harness.

Not released. `fourdgs 0.0.1` on crates.io is a name reservation, published by hand to hold the name
against Cargo's rule that a crate name may not begin with a digit; it contains no implementation and
nothing should depend on it. The first release with a decoder in it will be `0.1.0`, and it will be
cut from a tag like every other release here.
